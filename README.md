# face-morph

![](data/out/out.gif)

A implementation of image morphing via affine transformations of key points in pure Clojure!

This is my first Clojure project, and performance is still a bit slower than a OpenCV implementation, so it serves more of a toy project & example for anyone working on affine transforms in Clojure.

## Installation

Download the file from the release page.

## Usage


    $ java -jar face-morph-standalone.jar [args]
